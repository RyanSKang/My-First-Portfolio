# <Module-Challenge-2>

## Description
The importance of creating a portfolio is to introduce yourself and display your work to employers and peers. My motivation to create this project was to further my understanding in HTML and CSS in order to structure a webpage from scratch to my own liking. Furthermore, it helped me have a better understanding in how to use display flex, inline, and block in order to make my webpage more presentable. This project forced me to exhaust my resources and use external sources in order to find the information I need and to apply them into my own work. I learned alot in class on the foundation of how CSS and HTML works, but I learned to outsource information from Youtube and other websites to help customize my portfolio in way I never thought was possible. I was surprised how long my Stylesheet was due to excessive styling needed in order to get each section to the way I want. I had a narrow mindset that CSS was not that useful because I didn't have a grasp understanding and always thought it structured the webpage to look very elementary. After doing my own research I was able to open my eyes and explore CSS in a way to make my portfolio look professional. I followed the guidelines of this project for the most part, but decided to be more adventurous and take a different route in criterias where I could,to really express my portfolio differently. I learned how to link new fonts into VS Code and images. Lastly, I learned to organize my HTML and CSS using comments to really break the webpage down so I dont get lost when the application is not doing what I intended. This project was very fun, and I am looking forward for the next!
